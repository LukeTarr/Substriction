# Substriction
A web app to keep track of subscriptions.
This app was made as my final project for my INFSCI 1059 Web Programming class at The University of Pittsburgh.


Hosted on my University's Apache Server here: http://studentprojects.sis.pitt.edu/sping2020/lrt22/FinalProject/index.php

# Why won't this work when I clone it?
It's missing the db.php file which includes all the credentials to my MySQL server/account and returns a connection to the database.

# Tech Stack
1. HTML5, CSS3, JS ES6 for the front end

2. PHP 7.4 running on an Apache Server

3. MySQL Databse for persistence

4. Bootstrap 4 for foundation and theming
